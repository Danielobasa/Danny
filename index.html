<p>My Dearest [Nance], Yes, without the Y,</p>
  
This was a rush, I had no idea on what to do, I didn't even ask you, but part of me felt you were expectant.
    
There’s something undeniably special about what we share. It’s not just about the past but the way we understand each other in a way that feels effortless. Every conversation, every laugh, and every little moment reminds me why you’ve always had a place in my heart.  

I won’t say I never missed you (because that would be the biggest lie of my life), but what matters is that we’ve found our way back to something that still feels just as real.  

You bring a kind of peace, joy, and chaos that I wouldn’t trade for anything. The way you care, the way you show up, the way you make me feel—it all speaks louder than words. And as we take things one step at a time, I just want you to know that no matter where life takes us, I’m grateful to be sharing this chapter with you.  

So, today, on Valentine’s, I just want to remind you: You are special. You are loved. I hate your campus boyfriend so much. And you are mine… if you still want to be. 💖  

Happy Valentine’s Day, love.   

<p><strong>Happy Valentine's Day, my love❤️.</strong></p>

<p>Still Yours,</p>
