<p>My Dearest [Tequila],</p>

Happy Valentine's Day! üåπ I wanted to take a moment to let you know how much you mean to me, not just today, but every day.
Our journey hasn't been weird, has it?, But through it all, you've become more than just an ordinary friend, one of my closest friends, my go-to person for everything from silly jokes to serious talks.
I cherish the way we've navigated the transition from romance to friendship, learning and growing together along the way. You've shown me what true connection looks like, and I'm grateful for the bond we share.
So, here's to us‚Äîtwo souls who found each other in unexpected ways, and who continue to support, uplift, and care for one another. I couldn't imagine this journey without you by my side.
Happy Valentine's Day, Nana. Here's to many more adventures together!

<p><strong>Happy Valentine's Day, my love‚ù§Ô∏è.</strong></p>

<p>Forever Yoursü§û,</p>

<p>Danielü§≠</p>
